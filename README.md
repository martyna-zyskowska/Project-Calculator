## General Info
The simple calculator project is focused on numbers and arithmetics operations. The end result of the calculator is to provide a correct result of mathematical operation.
## Screenshots
![Example screenshot](./img/screenshot.png)
## Technologies
Project is created with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS ES6
## Status
Project is: _in progress_
## Code Examples

```
function oper(value) {
  var result = document.getElementById("result");
  if (result.value.length !== 0) {
     var lastChar = result.value.slice(result.value.length-1);
     var regularExpression = /[0-9]/;
     var re = /^(\+|-|\*|\/|=|>|<|>=|<=|&|\||%|!|\^|\(|\))$/;
     if (lastChar.match(regularExpression) !== null) {
        result.value += value;
     }
     else if (lastChar.match(re) !== null) {
        document.getElementById("result").value = document.getElementById("result").value.slice(0, -1) + value;
     }
  }
}
```

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Mathematical operations are working as expected
* Results of operations are correct (with the use of mathematical order of operations)
* Operators cannot be entered more than once if the last character is not a number
* if the user changes his or her mind and decide to change the operator, the calculator will replace the last character (for example from "+" to "-")
* Decimal point or operators cannot be enterd if the result field is empty

To-do list:
* Decimal point can be only provided once in one string
* Evaluation after every operation (block mathematical order of operations)
